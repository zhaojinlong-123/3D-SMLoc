# 3D-SMLoc
A Novel Dataset and Framework for 3D Semantic Mapping and Long-Term Localization in Underground Parking Lots

#3D-SMLoc Dataset
We build the first 3D semantic mapping and long-term localization dataset( 3D-SMLoc) for autonomous driving 
in underground parking lots. Our dataset performs visual front-view, Inertial, surrounding-view and lidar data
collection over more than one year. The data contains different scenarios of underground parking lots in campus 
and shopping malls, considering different lighting, traffic flow and other conditions. For each frame data, semantic
features such as contain columns, traffic signs, arrows, parking lines and speed bumps are carefully labeled.
